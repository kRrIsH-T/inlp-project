    """
    Returns a hook function that ablates specific features using the SAE.

    This uses CONDITIONAL NEGATIVE SCALING: if a targeted feature fires,
    we explicitly invert and amplify its activation (e.g., scale * z_sparse).
    This actively suppresses the feature's contribution ONLY on tokens
    where it tries to activate, preserving general capabilities (perplexity)
    unlike unconditional steering.

    Args:
        sae: The trained Sparse Autoencoder
        feature_indices_to_ablate: Tensor of feature indices to ablate
        mean_activations: (Unused in this updated method, kept for signature compatibility)
        scale: Scaling factor. 0.0 means standard zero-ablation.
               -5.0 means conditional negative steering.
